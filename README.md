## PlantDiseaseClassification App

This repo contains react-Native project codes for an app which works with a Keras Model that can predict diseases in plants given the images of their leaves. This app works as a simulator for plotting the predictive disease spreadth in a crop field.
Keras model considered is based on NASNET model and trained with tensorflow backend over the Village-Disease Dataset publicly available.
